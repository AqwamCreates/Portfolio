<h2>Soft Skills</h2>

	<tr>
		<td>Leadership</td>
		<td>Most of the time, I take the lead in university's group projects if other people are hesitant to take on the role.
		<br>I also took over whole software engineering group project when the previous leader produced wrong product prototype
		<br>and the deadline for the prototype is within a month.</td>
	<tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Presentation</td>
		<td>As a group leader for some of the courseworks, I tend to use a lot of visualization to compress complicated concepts
		<br>to simple ones.</td>
	<tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Computational Thinking</td>
		<td>Thanks to my ability to break down large problems into smaller ones, I can achieve high efficiency in programming 
		<br>required solutions. The skills includes decomposition, pattern recognition, pattern abstraction and algorithm designs.
		<br>When I was a Freelance Roblox Game Developer, you can see that very large amount of work is done in short time.</td>
	<tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Reverse Engineering</td>
		<td>No documentations? Poor quality code? No problem!
		<br>I can easily figure out the responsibilities of each line of code. With enough time, the whole software will
		<br>eventually be understood and documented by me. When I was a Freelance Roblox Game Developer, 
		<br>I immediately implemented requested features few days after being hired.</td>
